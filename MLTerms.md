## Pearson Correlation Coefficient
It is a measure of linear correlation/relationship between two variables x and y. <br>
Its value lies between +1 and -1. <br>
+1 : total positive linear correlation <br>
0 : no linear correlation <br>
-1 : total negative linear correlation <br>

In statistical terms,
**correlation coefficient** of two variables is the **covariance** of these variables divided by the product of their **standard deviations**.

$$
\rho_{x,y} = \frac{cov(x,y}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$
