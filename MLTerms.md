## Pearson Correlation Coefficient
It is a measure of linear correlation/relationship between two variables x and y. <br>
Its value lies between +1 and -1. <br>
* +1 : total positive linear correlation
*  0 : no linear correlation
* -1 : total negative linear correlation

In statistical terms,
**correlation coefficient** of two variables is the **covariance** of these variables divided by the product of their **standard deviations**.
